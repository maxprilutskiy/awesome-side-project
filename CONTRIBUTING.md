# üòç Contribution Guidelines
If you would like to contribute a useful app or tool - send me a Pull Request. Please, follow the following rules:

* Please, check your spelling and grammar.
* Please, check MY spelling and grammar too: issue a PR if you see something embarassing.
* Create separate Pull Requests for each suggestion.
* Search previous suggestions before making a new one to avoid duplicates. If the suggestion exists - please upvote instead of creating a new PR.
* Try making your Pull Request as informative as possible. Tell how the app or tool you're submitting was helpful to you. I hope you personally use stuff that you‚Äôre recommending, and aren't just shamelessly advertising.
* Put your content as the last item of the subcategory.


## üíÑ Format
Please, use the following format for the links in Pull Requests:
```
-<tab>[Name of the tool](Link to the landing page) - Description, 1-2 sentences max.

<tab>[Pricing](Link to the pricing page): Description about what is included into the free plan.

```

For example:

```
-   [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions) - CI/CD workflow automations

    [Pricing](https://github.com/features/actions): up to 2K build minutes per month, free for open source.

```


## üí¨ Requirements
* Please submit only the tools that are free, have free plans, or charge per transaction if it's a financial tool: it's absolutely important that the tool you're submitting is really easy to try out.
* Please don't submit obviously promotional content with low quality of landing page and/or the app itself.
* Please submit apps and tools that can be useful for engineers building side projects.
* When submitting your recommendation - explain how exactly it can be helpful.


## üßê Review Process
I'll do my best to review your submission as soon as I can. Although keep in mind that it might take a couple of days: I'll need to review it first and check whether it respects the rules above. Your submission might also be rejected if it's irrelevant or is of a low quality. Is it subjective? Yep. Am I doing this for the interests of engineers? Absolutely! But, if you feel me being unfair - please reach out and let me know.

Good luck!
