[![Tweet about Side Project Kit](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url?style=social&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmaxprilutskiy%2Fside-project-kit)](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https://github.com/maxprilutskiy/side-project-kit&text=A%20curated%20collection%20of%20tools%20that%20make%20side%20project%20development%20much%20easier%20%F0%9F%98%8D%0A%0Aby%20@MaxPrilutskiy)

<br />

The collection is split into 3 main parts:
* üë©‚Äçüíª Build - resources that help building projects faster and with less effort;
* üîÅ Iterate - apps that allow iterating on projects faster and develop what really matters;
* üì¶ Package - tools that make projects look cool and professional, and helpful while preparing for launch.

I faced these questions when worked on side projects over the last several years. During that time I tested, gave up on, searched again, and bookmarked plenty of tools that eventually helped me a lot! I hope you will find them helpful too. Good luck! üòâ
