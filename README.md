**Side Project Kit** is a curated collection of tools that make side project development much easier.

## 🌟
## 🌟 If you find this collection helpful - please give it a star ;)
## 🌟



The collection is split into 3 main parts:
* 👩‍💻 Build - resources that help building projects faster and with less effort;
* 🔁 Iterate - apps that allow iterating on projects faster and develop what really matters;
* 📦 Package - tools that make projects look cool and professional, and helpful while preparing for launch.

I faced these questions when worked on side projects over the last several years. During that time I tested, gave up on, searched again, and bookmarked plenty of tools that eventually helped me a lot! I hope you will find them helpful too. Good luck! 😉
